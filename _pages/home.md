I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Guilin Qi](http://cse.seu.edu.cn/PersonalPage/qgl/index.htm).
My research interests mainly lie in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

Recently, I am focusing on Information Extraction (IE) from unstructured text. Specifically, I am interested in designing IE algorithms that do not suffer from human annotation dependence.
